# JavaFX-Connect-Four
Created Connect Four using JavaFX

## How to Play: 
Two players go against each other in a game of Connect Four, where each player must connect tiles of their own color in a row, whether it be horizontal, diagonal, or vertical. The game ends once someone connects four of the same color, or when the board is filled completely.

To play...
1) Download Eclipse IDE (https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).
2) Clone this repository.
3) Open up this repository in Eclipse.
4) Run the GuiConnectFour.java file.

### Controls: 
The `NUMPAD` is used for dropping tiles into a column. The number above the column corresponds to which number key should be pressed to drop a token into that particular column. The UI also displays who's current turn it is.
